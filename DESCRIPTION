Description: Existing tools for fitting bespoke statistical models (such as
    BUGS, JAGS and STAN) are very effective for moderately-sized problems, but
    don't scale so well to large datasets. These tools also require users to learn
    a domain-specific language and fix errors at compile time. greta enables users
    to construct probabilistic models interactively in native R code, then sample
    from those models efficiently using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. TensorFlow is used
    to perform all of the calculations, so greta is particularly fast where the
    model contains very linear algebra operations. greta can also be run across
    distributed machines or on GPUs, just by installing the relevant version of
    TensorFlow. This package is in the early stages of development. Future releases
    will likely enable fitting models with fast approximate inference schemes,
    different samplers, and more distributions and operations.
