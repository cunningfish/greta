# greta: probabilistic modelling with TensorFlow

`greta` lets users write probabilistic models interactively in native R code, then sample from those models efficiently using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
Most of the calculations are performed using TensorFlow, so `greta` is particularly fast where the model contains lots of linear algebra. `greta` models can also be run across distributed machines or on GPUs, just by installing the relevant version of TensorFlow.

This package is in the early stages of development. Future releases will likely enable fitting models with fast approximate inference schemes, different samplers, and more distributions and operations.

## Example

The following example fits a large hierarchical linear regression model using `greta`.

First we create a large (10,000 observations, 100 covariates) fake dataset:

```{r eval = TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
n <- 10000
m <- 100

true_alpha <- -3
true_beta <- rnorm(m, 1, 2)
true_sigma <- 3

covariates <- matrix(rnorm(n * m, 0, 10),
                     nrow = n,
                     ncol = m)

true_z <- true_alpha + covariates %*% true_beta
response <- rnorm(n, true_z, true_sigma)
```

Then we load `greta` and define our model

```{r eval = TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE} 
library(greta)

# define data as observed variables
x = observed(covariates)
y = observed(response)

# priors
sigma = lognormal(0, 10)
alpha = normal(0, 10)
mu_beta <- normal(0, 10)
sigma_beta <- lognormal(0, 10)

# linear model with hierarchical structure on the m regression coefficients
beta = normal(mu_beta, sigma_beta, dim = m)
z = alpha + x %*% beta

# data likelihood term (y already defined as observed)
y %~% normal(z, sigma)
```

With the model defined, we can start drawing samples of the parameters we care about. This runs in around a minute on my laptop. It should go much faster if you run it on a GPU!

```{r eval = FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
draws <- samples(alpha, beta, sigma,
                method = 'hmc',
                n_samples = 1000)
```

### Installation

`greta` can be installed from github using the devtools package

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('goldingn/greta')
```

however `greta` depends on TensorFlow and the `tensorflow` R package, which will need to be succesfully installed before `greta` will work. To install `tensorflow`, you will need a working installation of python; to have installed the correct version of TensorFlow; and then to install tensorflow, pointing to the version of python against which TensorFlow was installed. Full installation details can be found [at the `tensorflow` site](https://rstudio.github.io/tensorflow/).

## Why 'greta'?

There's a recent convention of naming probabilistic modelling software after pioneers in the field (e.g. [STAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam) and [Edward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)).

[Grete Hermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grete_Hermann) wasn't a probabilist, but she wrote [the first algorithms](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=307342&coll=portal&dl=ACM) for computer algebra; in the 1920s, well before the first electronic computer was built. This work laid the foundations for computer algebra libraries (like TensorFlow) that enable modern probabilistic modelling.

In case that's not enough reason to admire her, Grete Hermann also [disproved a popular theorem in quantum theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3986.pdf) and was part of the German resistance against the Nazi regime prior to World War Two.

Grete (usually pronounced *Greh*â€¢tuh, like its alternate spelling *Greta*) is pretty confusing for most non-German speakers, so I've taken the liberty of naming the package greta instead. You can call it whatever you like.
